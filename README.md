# EPT - Expectation Programming in Turing

Expectation Programming in Turing (EPT) enables target-aware Bayesian inference for models specified in Turing. 
Switching from a Turing model to an EPT model is as simple as replacing Turing's `@model` macro with EPT's `@expectation`.
See https://github.com/treigerm/ExpectationProgrammingExperiments for example usage.
A more in-depth introduction to EPT can be found in the paper [Expectation Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04953).
